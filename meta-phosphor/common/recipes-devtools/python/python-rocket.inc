SUMMARY = "Modern, multi-threaded and extensible web server."
DESCRIPTION = "The Rocket web server is a server designed to handle the increased \
needs of modern web applications implemented in pure Python. It can serve WSGI \
applications and static files. Rocket has the ability to be extended to handle \
different types of networked request-response jobs. Rocket runs on cPython 2.5- 3.x \
and Jython 2.5 (without the need to run through the 2to3 translation tool). Rocket \
is similar in purpose to Cherrypyâ€™s Wsgiserver but with added flexibility and concurrency."
